the oberoi new delhi was the perfect place to stay on our first night and on our last night in india the hotel is as expected for an accommodation of this caliber the staff was professional friendly and super helpful and most importantly the two rooms we had were clean and in working condition we did however expected more from the layout and the decor of the room it is smaller than we expected and the decor was a bit generic the threesixty restaurant on the ground floor was pretty decent and also provided excellent service one big negative for us is the extra charge for wifi who does that these days this is a charge that should be included in the room price as it is distasteful to have to pay extra for a service like this especially at a hotel where most guests are international visitors

we were not expecting the high level of personal service great food and quality stay we received from what we thought would be a business hotel great stop off en route to travels round northern india we arrived from an all night flight to be offered breakfast before even going to our rooms just what we needed a superb feast our rooms were really comfortable and clean slightly dated decor but faultless the swimming pool area was stunning so secluded we forgot we were in busy delhi as soon as we got there it is a really well run friendly and impressive hotel and one to thoroughly recommend

mine was just a one night stay in this short stay what impressed me the most is their professional care blended with personal touch the people are very smart well attired soft spoken with smiling face and welcoming gesture they will make you comfortable immediately with informal chat even there is a reasonable delay for just 5 mins at the reception they would treat you at their restaurant with a cup of coffee while you sip your coffee they will come to you for completing the paper work formalities they will not press you for anything no promotional offerings no sales talk room service turnaround time is the fastest i ever experienced they demonstrate their sincerity not just by their words but by their service quality and promptness they will help you selecting food according to your need thanks to the management for fostering this nice culture and professionalism that is compatible with the great brand of oberoi i feel like staying in this hotel again and i would definitely recommend my friends to stay in this hotel thanks

this hotel provides service that sets a standard the staff is always courteous polite and meets your every need at every point of the hotel the hotel itself is beautifully appointed and will meet your needs from the fitness centers to the nicely appointed and very quiet rooms you cannot but notice the staff the restaurant is well worth visiting for breakfast or dinner the lounge is excellent for a relaxing drink or quiet meeting

we made 2 stays one of 2 nights and the other one night we were met at the door and escorted to the arrival desk then escorted to our luxurious room for registration our room overlooked the golf course service was excellent with smiling helpful staff a special thank you to chef gunjit singh chawla for subtly flavoured food in the 360 restaurant swimming pool situated in a beautiful garden and as we were sunbathing saw an eagle come to drink plugs for charging in the bedside tables choice of pillows and complimentary accessories replenished when used an elegant hotel with swift and efficient service

very comfortable great location attention to detail a place to relax and feel calm at the end of a working day or active sight seeing but the outstanding attraction of the oberoi is the quality of its services its team is highly polished and consistently of great quality be it for housekeeping mr ayush is an excellent example or breakfast service mr himanshu is another excellent example service is very courteous personalized and of the highest standard a reason for me to always choose the oberoi when coming to delhi

r20
everything about this hotel is wonderful our room was a complimentary upgrade to a suite the restaurant was great the staff are outstanding and you really feel they want you to be there it would be unfair to pick out any individual for special mention everyone was so welcoming and calm but also efficient it is worth flying to india for this experience no where else in the world have i ever felt so spoilt and cosseted
r20
r21
we had a very comfortable stay here the staff in the whole hotel were so friendly and helpful and the food and service were fantastic we would without doubt come back here on our last morning at breakfast we were given a cake with bon voyage on it it was yummy

after staying at the oberoi hotels in jaipur and agra upon arriving here i was a little underwhelmed yes the hotel had luxury brand stores available for your shopping pleasre but other than that and its patisserie i did not think it was anything grand again like other oberoi hotels the staff is friendly welcoming and quick to help with anything you need the lobby and restaurants were mostly clean except we noticed that the waiters would reuse silverware if you did not seem to use it at your table some of our dishes and silverware looked unclean and some had remnants of food on them i m not sure if anyone gives it a quick look before setting the tables we booked an executive suite which included a small dining and living room area the bedroom was decent size but the bathroom was teeny tiny i m not sure if a pipe had recently burst or something but i felt like our room smelled like urine too tired and since we were going to be out and about most of the day anyways i had lysol and essential oils so i just tried to freshen the room myself i see the cleaning crew on each level work really hard so i didn t want to trouble them i was also disappointed that there was construction going on above below or nearby our room so we could hear drilling hammering going on this was also going on in the spa area definitely not relaxing the pool area could be better we stayed at the oberoi hotels in jaipur and agra and were amazed at how pretty they were the pool here was just a tad better than what you might expect at a marriott or the like i had higher expectations for this oberoi property being that it is located in the capital of india
r23
r24
i had a wonderful stay at the oberoi new delhi the staff are very friendly although the larger size of the hotel means that it feels a little more impersonal that its sister hotel in bangalore the breakfast and all day dining is spectacular and the staff in the restaurant are very impressive i experienced only 1 down side and that happened after i checked out the hotel transport an official hotel car and driver to the airport spent the entire trip hinting very very heavily about tipping not only was the uncomfortable but it really put me off and seemed so unprofessional compared to the rest of my experiences at the oberoi where i usually might have tipped i didn t in this instance as i felt so uncomfortable
r24
r25
i enjoyed staying at oberoi the service was excellent very good quality food and beverages were served and the location is great very close to the airport and many things in the city for shopping you have khan market and lajpat nagar which are very close
r25
r26
we stayed for one night at the start of a short trip to india we were collected from the airport in the hotel car it has free wifi on arrival we were upgraded to a better room and even though it was about 10 00 we had immediate access to our room we had the sunday lunch spread in the restaurant fairly expensive but as it includes all the drinks you want not unreasonably so i would certainly do it again the hotel is close to the khan market we asked for a taxi to take us there the round trip with 1 1 2 hours waiting was under 300 inr about 6 00 the butler brought us a complementary bottle of wine and some fruit kebabs and chocolate later he brought us a chocolate cake after we had left we discovered we had left a cafetiere behind we were staying in another oberoi hotel and were planning to return to delhi and stay at the gurgaon at the end of our stay i asked if it could be arranged for the cafetiere to be taken to the gurgaon instead it was sent down to us in jaipur what service any other hotel we would have lost it only one complaint there is a half hour free wifi which is enough to download emails but most other hotels have free wifi all the time for continuous wifi the charge is 1000 inr plus taxes this seems expensive
r26
r27
i ve stayed twice at this hotel and i love it service is excellent twice during my one week stay i received small gifts from my room steward and the staff in the restaurant used my name every day after the first day they really go out of their way to make you feel at home this year i had some time to use the indoor and outdoor pools the hotel provided a small bottle of their own sunscreen as well as chilled bottled water and frozen grapes i also got a pedicure at the spa the price was very reasonable and again the service was great the rooms are average size decorated very nicely comfortable beds this is a five star hotel at a very reasonable price per night the breakfast buffet had a lot of choices and room service was good and pretty fast i hope to stay at this hotel again
r27
r28
