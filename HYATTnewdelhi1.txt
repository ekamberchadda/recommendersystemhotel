stayed 3 days at the hyatt regency late september stay was very good with very attentive and friendly staff rooms were clean and well appointed my only disappointment was the view from the rooms window all i could see was some type of machinery and builders rubbish not good for a top line hotel

this is definitely a great hotel i was a little annoyed by how attentive were staff at breakfast to the point that unfinished plates were taken away though i wanted to have more or when i got to help myself the plates were cleaned too quickly pool was ok the spa facilities stunning and the room top notch

we recently stayed for 5 days for a family break and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay the hotel is well located and has expansive lobby area the pool is large for kids to splash around the breakfast buffet is sumptuous and well thought out the only flip side the rooms are smaller in size the best part is though the staff very friendly informative and always willing to help we had misplaced our mobile at the airport which was promptly returned to us after the airport staff going out of their way to retrieve it thanks to ornelia for organizing this shantanu at front desk was ever helpful in answering all our queries to ensure we visited most of the tourist places but the breakfast staff headed by ashok rana was the best they make every effort to ensure you start your day with a smile thanks to the staff at hyatt for making our stay special room tip choose a higher floor room if possible stayed october 2014 travelled with family

the service at the hotel is exceptional they were extremely courteous and helpful the restaurants at the hotel are excellent the breakfast elaborate the rooms are slightly small and the heritage rooms which are the only connecting rooms were quite antiquated these rooms need to be refurbished the pool was lovely and the spa looked great
location wise it seemed central and everything was half an hour away great stay

we stayed here for one night while in transit through delhi i picked the hyatt for its supposed convenience to the airport although we tried 4 times to find a taxi at the airport that had any idea where it is located it was actually a half hour drive on a sunday afternoon but i m not certain that the driver went the quickest way
having said that the hotel itself is first class all the excellence you d expect from a hyatt great room great food great pool brilliant buffet breakfast quite a way from the tourist attractions of delhi but close to chanakyapuri i d highly recommend if you re in delhi on business in that area but is really too inconvenient if you re a tourist
we loved it stayed september 2014 travelled as a couple

i stayed here for a week whilst in delhi for work it was just what you need for work helpful staff good amenities and some great things going for it the rooms and general decor were what you would expect from this kind of hotel a bit over the top but in need of a touch up here and there however the flowers were so beautiful while we were there they had a few different displays that were mirrored throughout the hotel there was a slight smell of dampness in my room i was moved to another room which had only a slight whiff and just accepted that it was monsoon season in delhi the restaurants were actually really good the chinese in particular was fantastic i ve thought about the mixed green veg a few times since the italian was also good the main cafe was good for breakfast and for evening meals although i didn t eat the buffet which seemed to be the main feature stayed september 2014 travelled on business

we stayed here a week very pleasant experience the staff was amazing and trained well very helpful the italian resto within the hotel was good i would only stay on a higher floor next time as the 2nd floor has a bit of a smokey scent in the hallways breakfast was plentiful with almost anything you would need the gym was well equipped and had decent trainers on hand overall the hotel rooms bathroom was an odd design may need a touch up but definitely a good spot in delhi

stayed for 2 nights during last week of aug 14 we also had our corporate event in the ballroom the hotel management had meticulously planned the event and everything went as planned no surprises coming to their rooms the hotel was built in 1983 and so the hotel has to live with the 30 year old dimensions of the room and bath the room has enough space mirrors are used inside the room to give a more spacious feeling however this is not the same case with the bath it has only a half tub and a shower cubicle the half tub really shows the lack of space the major grouse i had is the lighting in front of the bath mirror without any shaving mirror lights and with only the overhead lights one would get a lot of shadow on your face it s difficult to get a perfect shave i am sure women would also find the lighting lacking for their needs i fail to understand how a 5 star hotel has overlooked the lighting aspect in the bath the staff are very courteous and they ensure all your requests are taken care the hotel is impeccably maintained given it s age food is 5 star
the internet wifi connectivity is good throughout the hotel i had to test this for our event i got 4 mbps everywhere no disconnections the first 3 room categories are of the same size the first upgrade is a room of the same size but with a pool facing window the next upgrade is again of the same size but on a floor with access to the regency club another issue is that there is no direct elevator access from the rooms to their ballroom you need to get down from the elevator at the lobby level and then take the steps down to the level below where the ballrooms are stayed august 2014 travelled on business

we arrived at the hyatt regency delhi after flying in to delhi airport security is very tight at the entrance to the hotel airport scanners are used to check your luggage as you enter it is comforting to know that security is taken so seriously once through and into the foyer you enter a haven of peace the foyer is large and beautiful and the staff very attentive after checking in and being shown to our room our luggage appeared minutes later there are at least 5 restaurants in the hotel we really enjoyed the thai and the indian restaurants and the italian normally in the evenings we would stop at the bar and watch the area around the pool being set up for the next wedding or watch the wedding ceremony unfold before us fascinating all staff were very attentive the only drawback we found was catching a tuktuk form the front of the hotel we wanted to go to dilli haat a market not far from the hotel and the tuk tuk driver took us to the other side of delhi to one of his friends markets very disconcerting and slightly scary but we survived and it gave us another story to tell all in all a wonderful hotel and could not have been better looked after stayed november 2013 travelled as a couple

stayed here on two trips to india the last stay being a few years ago the first time my family and i stayed for 7 nights and the second time for the weekend i cannot think of a single negative experience during my stays for my family and i the delhi hyatt was a little retreat spot after long and exciting days of traveling around delhi and just overall being ecstatic about being in india the sites the sounds the markets tourism and the interactions with people the delhi hyatt has many delicious restaurants and a medium sized shopping strip of stores off the lobby one time my daughter and i i strolled around the lower concourse where a young adult was working setting up tables for an event we had a delightful conversation about meaningful things in life and indian culture my daughter and i also met santa claus in the lobby one beautiful christmas day during our first visit our family dreams of our return stayed october 2013 travelled with family

my recent stay at the hyatt regency delhi proved that its not just the property but its employees and their service that makes ones stay memorable right from my check in to my check out with everything including restaurant bar fitness center regency club experience was all about the staff that actually cares minor hiccups were promptly taken care of and i actually left the hotel with a fond memory i have stayed at many hyatts worldwide and have concluded that the service at this property rules kudos to the gm and his team that is providing a world class service would recommend a stay all the way room tip ask for a pool facing and recently renovated room better still stay on the regency club floor since

after reading some reviews about the small room size i was quite concerned about staying in the hyatt but when i arrived although the rooms were smaller than the radisson i stayed at in agra previously they were still very comfortable the hotel itself is absolutely massive with a shopping complex that felt like a small shopping centre the spa was extremely luxurious i would definitely recommend it the best spa at any hotel i ve stayed at the pool area is brilliant although very deep and at night there s a beautiful view of the hotel lit up the service in all the restaurants is impeccable with a waiter available all the time and the buffet is delicious again one of the best i ve ever had overall one of the best and most luxurious hotels i have ever stayed at and i would definitely recommend it stayed august 2014

stayed here over several business trips to delhi and each stay had me disappointed as there was invariably something wrong missing from the room i was given the last straw was when they forgot to send the airport pick up and after arriving at the reception on a taxi at 11 30pm the rooms were not ready and i had to wait 30 minutes
needless to say i never went back switched to the westin stayed october 2013 travelled on business
