The Oberoi, New Delhi was the perfect place to stay on our first night, and on our last night in India. The hotel is as expected for an accommodation of this caliber. The staff was professional, friendly and super helpful, and most importantly, the two rooms we had were clean, and in working condition. We did, however expected more from the layout and the decor of the room. It is smaller than we expected, and the decor was a bit generic. The Threesixty restaurant on the ground floor was pretty decent, and also provided excellent service. One BIG negative for us is the extra charge for wifi. Who does that these days? This is a charge that should be included in the room price, as it is distasteful to have to pay extra for a service like this, especially at a hotel where most guests are international visitors.

As usual Oberoi is great! Service, cleanliness, architecture, interiors, everything is on it's best level. We were pleased with Italian restaurant staff and chef care for us! My partner didn't like the simple spaghetti. (He is not big italian cuisine lover))) So chef came to us, manager and waiter.They were too much worried that he would stay hungry and unsatisfied. Immediately they changed the dish the way my friend likes. And also chef made for us special desert complementary)) That was really nice. Thnx to them a lot.

Basically I love Oberoi in Delhi, but something makes it really great: The Breakfast Staff Ballet orchestrated by Abbhi, he welcomes you as if you were the most important guest and immediately goes to anyone with the same amount of sweetness and professionalism. What a wonderfull starter for the day!!! Bravo c est excellent!

The service is stunning. The staff could not do enough to please us. I would rate the pool setting as the best of all the pools at the many hotel where we stayed during our month in asia. Excellent breakfast buffet.

We were not expecting the high level of personal service, great food and quality stay we received from what we thought would be a business hotel. Great stop off en route to travels round northern India! We arrived from an all night flight to be offered breakfast before even going to our rooms - just what we needed & a superb feast! Our rooms were really comfortable and clean (slightly dated decor, but faultless). The swimming pool area was stunning & so secluded we forgot we were in busy Delhi as soon as we got there. It is a really well run, friendly and impressive hotel and one to thoroughly recommend.

I've stayed at this hotel 3 or 4 times and regret not writing a review before now. It is a secure retreat adjacent to ND Golf Club. A great location to explore ND. Equally an excellent venue for business. Plenty of dining options and the bar is a great place to relax anytime of the day. Spend an afternoon at the pool - just a delight. Don't hesitate in staying at the Oberoi. Pay that little extra for a truly wonderful experience.

I had a great stay at the Oberoi. Everyone is eager to please you and will do everything they can to help. If you decide to walk down the lobby with a bag, their staff will drop everything they are doing and rush to help you with the suitcase. The level of service is outstanding. The breakfast is excellent. This is the place to stay in New Delhi! It is like an oasis to retreat from the chaos and the noise of the city. The pool and the gym were very nice - they had an excellent trainer in the gym who helped me. The staff in the restaurant were very friendly and welcoming. I strongly recommend the Oberoi, New Delhi.

Mine was just a one night stay. In this short stay, what impressed me the most is their professional care blended with personal touch. The people are very smart, well attired, soft spoken with smiling face and welcoming gesture. They will make you comfortable immediately with informal chat. Even there is a reasonable delay for just 5 mins at the reception, they would treat you at their restaurant with a cup of coffee. While you sip your coffee they will come to you for completing the paper work formalities. They will not press you for anything. No promotional offerings. No sales talk. Room service turnaround time is the fastest, I ever experienced. They demonstrate their sincerity not just by their words but by their service quality and promptness. They will help you selecting food according to your need. Thanks to the Management for fostering this nice culture and professionalism that is compatible with the great brand of Oberoi. I feel like staying in this hotel again. And I would definitely recommend my friends to stay in this Hotel. Thanks

Stayed here for one night only before travelling on to Agra and Jaipur also to stay in Oberoi hotels. First class hotels with first class facilities and exceptional service. If you don't like this hotel chain you wont like anything!

On arriving at Delhi airport we where greeted by Oberoi staff, and were whisked away to the hotel in lovely black BMW's, with cold towels and drinks and free Wi-fi! Upon arriving at the hotel at 6.30am, we were shown to our awaiting rooms and then given the most wonderful breakfast. The pool was a great haven, again with cold towels, frozen grapes and drinks. The staff were so helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was amazing with the pasties pasties l have ever seen! The staff also love to show you the Indian breakfast, and we sampled everything and more! A wonderful start to our Indian adventure, Oberoi hotels are the best.

Stayed here on a business trip for a couple of days . Did not have a chance to explore much, but had very pleasant stay. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The hotel is centrally located and the property is very well maintained . Hotel has the modern amenities, and rightly qualifies to be luxurious.

This hotel provides service that sets a standard. The staff is always courteous, polite and meets your every need at every point of the hotel. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and will meet your needs from the fitness centers to the nicely appointed and very quiet rooms, you cannot but notice the staff. The restaurant is well worth visiting for breakfast or dinner. The lounge is excellent for a relaxing drink or quiet meeting.

We made 2 stays, one of 2 nights and the other one night.We were met at the door and escorted to the arrival desk, then escorted to our luxurious room for registration. Our room overlooked the golf course.Service was excellent with smiling helpful staff.A special thank you to Chef Gunjit Singh Chawla for subtly flavoured food in the 360 restaurant.Swimming pool situated in a beautiful garden and as we were sunbathing saw an eagle come to drink.Plugs for charging in the bedside tables, choice of pillows and complimentary accessories replenished when used.An elegant hotel with swift and efficient service.

The Oberoi is quite simply the best hotel that I have ever stayed in. The facilities are first class, the rooms are sumptuous and very comfortable and the service is simply world class.Nothing was too much bother, the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and they all pride themselves on giving excellent service.The restaurants are all excellent with a very wide range of food all well cooked and presented. The hotel has three swimming pools and an excellent gym and a range of therapies.I would highly recommend this hotel for business people, holidaymakers and families.

From the moment we arrived the hotel staff is amazing wonderful hotel. I would stay there again. Best part we stay three days and the breakfast bar was excellent se many choices and what made our breakfast so special every morning was Chief Surya he would make us every morning something different from his country and it was presented we love and you can tell he loves to cook and please his guest. His cooking was excellent. I would recommend asking for him and let him make you a special dish as you still enjoy the breakfast bar. He is proud to do it and try his dish named after him Surya. It was delicious one way to try their food so ask for him you will be happy you did. This hotel was 100% excellent I would highly go back.

Very comfortable, great location, attention to detail, a place to relax and feel calm at the end of a working day or active sight-seeing. But the outstanding attraction of the Oberoi is the quality of its services. Its team is highly polished and consistently of great quality. Be it for housekeeping (Mr Ayush is an excellent example) or breakfast service (Mr Himanshu is another excellent example), service is very courteous, personalized and of the highest standard. A reason for me to always choose the Oberoi when coming to Delhi.

Everything about this hotel is wonderful - our room was a complimentary upgrade to a suite, the restaurant was great . The staff are outstanding and you really feel they want you to be there.It would be unfair to pick out any individual for special mention - everyone was so welcoming and calm but also efficient.It is worth flying to India for this experience ! No where else in the world have I ever felt so spoilt and cosseted

After staying at the Oberoi hotels in Jaipur and Agra, upon arriving here I was a little underwhelmed. Yes, the hotel had luxury brand stores available for your shopping pleasre but other than that and its patisserie, I did not think it was anything grand. Again, like other Oberoi hotels, the staff is friendly, welcoming, and quick to help with anything you need.The lobby and restaurants were mostly clean except we noticed that the waiters would reuse silverware if you did not seem to use it at your table. Some of our dishes and silverware looked unclean and some had remnants of food on them. I'm not sure if anyone gives it a quick look before setting the tables.We booked an executive suite which included a small dining and living room area. The bedroom was decent size but the bathroom was teeny tiny. I'm not sure if a pipe had recently burst or something but I felt like our room smelled like urine. Too tired and since we were going to be out and about most of the day anyways, I had Lysol and essential oils so I just tried to freshen the room myself. I see the cleaning crew on each level work really hard so I didn't want to trouble them. I was also disappointed that there was construction going on above, below, or nearby our room so we could hear drilling/hammering going on. This was also going on in the spa area. Definitely not relaxing. The pool area could be better. We stayed at the Oberoi hotels in Jaipur and Agra and were amazed at how pretty they were. The pool here was just a tad better than what you might expect at a Marriott or the like.I had higher expectations for this Oberoi property being that it is located in the capital of India.

I had a wonderful stay at the Oberoi, New Delhi. The staff are very friendly, although the larger size of the hotel means that it feels a little more impersonal that its sister hotel in Bangalore. The breakfast and all-day dining is spectacular and the staff in the restaurant are very impressive! I experienced only 1 down-side, and that happened after I checked out. The hotel transport (an official hotel car and driver) to the airport spent the entire trip hinting very very heavily about tipping. Not only was the uncomfortable, but it really put me off and seemed so unprofessional compared to the rest of my experiences at the Oberoi. Where I usually might have tipped, I didn't in this instance as I felt so uncomfortable.

I enjoyed staying at Oberoi. The service was excellent. Very good quality food and beverages were served. And the location is great - very close to the airport and many things in the city. For shopping, you have Khan Market and Lajpat Nagar which are very close.

We stayed for one night at the start of a short trip to India. We were collected from the airport in the hotel car - it has free wifi. On arrival we were upgraded to a better room and, even though it was about 10:00 we had immediate access to our room.We had the Sunday lunch spread in the restaurant. Fairly expensive, but as it includes all the drinks you want, not unreasonably so. I would certainly do it again.The hotel is close to the Khan market. We asked for a taxi to take us there. The round trip with 1 1/2 hours waiting was under 300 INR! About 6:00 the butler brought us a complementary bottle of wine and some fruit kebabs and chocolate. Later he brought us a chocolate cake.After we had left we discovered we had left a cafetiere behind. we were staying in another Oberoi hotel and were planning to return to Delhi and stay at the Gurgaon at the end of our stay. I asked if it could be arranged for the cafetiere to be taken to the Gurgaon,. Instead it was sent down to us in Jaipur - what service. Any other hotel we would have lost it.Only one complaint - there is a half hour free wifi - which is enough to download emails, but most other hotels have free wifi all the time. For continuous wifi the charge is 1000 INR plus taxes - this seems expensive..

I've stayed twice at this hotel, and I love it. Service is excellent. Twice during my one week stay I received small gifts from my room steward, and the staff in the restaurant used my name every day after the first day. They really go out of their way to make you feel at home. This year I had some time to use the indoor and outdoor pools. The hotel provided a small bottle of their own sunscreen, as well as chilled bottled water and frozen grapes. I also got a pedicure at the spa. The price was very reasonable, and again, the service was great. The rooms are average size, decorated very nicely. Comfortable beds. This is a five star hotel at a very reasonable price per night. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices, and room service was good and pretty fast. I hope to stay at this hotel again.

I stayed in several properties in Delhi within the past 8 years and by far, the service and professionalism of the staff meet with my expectations. From my arrival to the departure, the staff i had the pleasure to meet really took god care of myself. I can only recommend this hotel perfectly managed.

My family an I stayed at the Oberoi in Delhi from August 21-23. The staff was extremely friendly, and the food was wonderful. My kids loved the pool. We were given 2 incredibly beautiful suites. It was our anniversary on the 23rd, the staff had given us a great bottle of wine in celebration. Our flight back to the US was late that evening. They allowed us to stay in the room until 7 pm. We had a great stay.
