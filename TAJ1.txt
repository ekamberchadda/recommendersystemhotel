the first hotel at the beginning of our first visit to india so a little uncertain we did not need to worry the welcome was wonderfully warm and friendly and we were shown to our room the room was well laid out in a traditional style with a very comfortable bed and facilities such as tea and coffee in the room very good air conditioning housekeeping was excellent with morning and evening service we paid the extra for club lounge access which is on the 8th floor this lounge is very comfortable with nice views the club lounge is serviced by a brigade of superb butlers who quickly identify your preferences and give outstanding service the club lounge is well worth the extra offering an excellent breakfast with cold and freshly prepared hot dishes afternoon tea at 3 30pm till 5pm and at 6 30pm to 8pm hot and cold canapés together with an open bar and throughout the day hot and cold drinks overall this is a superb club product well run and serviced we only ate in the indian restaurant varq which was superb modern indian food well worth a try lovely food and staff pool area is nice and comfortable lovely after a day sightseeing the pool staff are friendly and welcoming hotel location is ideal for sightseeing new and old delhi overall a superb choice for a delhi visit or as part of a tour

i stayed at the taj mahal hotel in new delhi earlier this year for 2 nights the staff are professional and helpful the service is first class the hotel is situated within walking distance of khan s market and many other tourist attractions the public areas of the hotel have a wonderful ambiance the service and standard of food in the restaurant is amazing be sure to try the baked yoghurt along with the abundance of fruit for breakfast
r6
r7
this hotel was a delight to stay in as well as the typical features of a luxury hotel there were two things that i loved from housekeeping s side one is that they tied up all the cords of my chargers with velcro to keep it tidy the other is that all my little bottles of shampoo nail clippers etc were tidily organized and in one place on a square hankerchief so i could easily find my own things even without my glasses i also loved the view of trees and greenery from my room it really felt like you were in a forest not a big grubby city the only thing that wasn t exceptional was the breakfast buffet the hyatt has a much nicer breakfast

we stayed here for a couple of nights and really enjoyed it all the staff were fantastic from the receptionists to the helpful concierge desk who organised cars for us and recommended places to eat to the housekeepers lift people and the restaurant staff particular thanks to dipti who helped me out at breakfast one morning we loved the feeling of the hotel the surroundings are very ornate yet the service was just perfect a lovely central hotel and we would love to come back one day

public areas are beautiful gorgeous pool buffet food good service very professional this hotel is all about business in every public area you will find people having meetings of all the taj hotels i stayed at in india this one was the most western in service rooms are comfortable but a little on the small size if your planning a function this is where this hotel excels deepak is amazing he can have a room turned around super fast the thing i liked best about him is that he is not afraid to say no that won t work taj need more people like deepak the business centre is very helpful if your looking for a family stay this is not your hotel

we had the perfect weekend at the perfect hotel as soon as we got off our car we had someone welcoming us and the same person dropped us to our room after checking us in what more could you ask for the restaurants in the hotel offer a wide choice of food the pool and the spa are good too
r10
r11
starting with the positives the airport transfer was with a lovely driver and car the great experience continued with the personal check in service directly in the room a butler was waiting with a welcome drink and did an excellent job on the shoe polishing the food was the best hotel food i ve had in india and the location is great this is all let down by dirty sheets musky smelling rooms and poor decor in desperate and urgent need of remodelling and makeover having stayed the previous week at the shangri la whilst it is not quite as good in the positive areas it s definitely a better over all experience hopefully taj will take more notice of this hotel and invest much needed money into upgrading its rooms

very chic not very big but well designed modern plush amenities at the same time wood carved ceiling making the name mahal worthy i ordered home cooked mutton curry from room service and it was a great piece of art i would say tender succulent and right blend of spices the average rating is for warq one anticipates that the taj mahal will have something signature as the dum pukth the taj is peculiar they are extremely warm and caring may sound interference for sum for the extroverts it is home coming the room service order taker did not hesitate to add a extra paratha indian bread realizing that i was famished central delhi if you like morning walks or a late night stroll india gate looks enchanting and is just a half a mile down the road nice warm place one has to shell out a few extra dollars to be here but the premium is well deserved
r12
r13
we were welcomed home to the taj when we arrived for our first visit and if felt like home the service was impeccable the room comfortable and with excellent air conditioning great touches like a small box of useful desk items scissors sticky tape paperclips etc define the attention to detail
our room was a taj club room well worth the extra as there is a quiet and really pleasant club room which serves light breakfast snacks hot drinks and cocktails for periods during the day the hotel is in the heart of delhi and so easy to travel about and it has some really lovely restaurants within if you want to stay home’definitely a great place to stay going back soon and looking forward to it

spent 4 nights at the taj mahal delhi in september the hotel is grand showing its age a bit but the service from the staff more than make up for this we had a lovely spacious room overlooking the pool and city we were lucky enough to be given club floor priviliges which was fantastic the staff were excellent the hotel is in the exclusive residential area of lutyens about 3 kms from connought place loved the 24x7 dining downstairs good food price and service will return

there are many great hotels in the world but what makes great into incredible is what someone should learn from taj and it is all about investing in people associates at taj mahal palace are very friendly professional yet give personal touch in their dealings with guests empathetic and go beyond what is expected from them to make the experience wonderful for guests right from the check in where firdaus provided me early check in at 5 30 am check in time is 2 pm i understand that he could do it because rooms were available at that time but which hotel does that even if the room is available farhan who engaged in friendly conversation while escorting me to the room people at the machaan restaurant i mean every bit was awesome i should also talk about breakfast experience spread was good though some other 5 star hotels have larger spread of menu but the interesting aspect was that everyone s food preferences are taken care of gluten free breads oriental food north indian and south indian menu english breakfast items variety of made to order stuff and best was egg less croissants and muffins i was so happy seeing this as being a lacto vegetarian i find it difficult to enjoy breakfast breads i just gorged on egg less croissants and muffins please do pass on this feedback to chef so that they continue with this decor of the hotel is just so royal lobby experience is one of its kind rooms are luxurious and comfortable spa is good too only a minor suggestion they could reduce prices of machaan restaurant a bit room rates are on a higher side if you compare it to other hotels but i would say every bit of that is worth it i am going to stay here for sure in my next visit to delhi
r15
r16
great location excellent rooms and grandeur are right words lovely breakfast and excellent hospitality staff is courteous it was my second stay here and i had come here after 5 years every thing is same
r16
r17
disappointing except for the fantastic restaurants in the basement this hotel needs an investment on the bedrooms the rooms are not sound tight i would go elsewhere the japanese restaurant wasabi served the best sushi ever the freshest wasabi creative miso soups all utterly divine the indian restaurant is in the top5 in india lovely interiors unexceptional cuisine
r17
r18
this has been my 8th or 9th stay at the hotel i must admit the overall service and courtesy of the hotel staff is commendable they have great facilities for guests who arrive for court hearings including library and pick up and drop to supreme court food quality is little bit on the continental style which needs little indian touch otherwise staff is great

this hotel was the first hotel i stayed at in india my room overlooked well manicured gardens and was extremely serene i received white glove service with tea and had a sweet room the pool itself was pristine and had beautiful cabanas although the hotel itself and all the grounds were gorgeous directly outside the hotel gates was another experience it seemed as though paradise was placed directly in the middle of a struggling neighborhood i did not feel safe without my colleagues outside the hotel grounds
r19
r20
stayed here 3 nights with my husband for a work conference the lobby is beautiful the room was fairly standard but clean and well catered for the variety of delicious food is huge however the standout thing for us was the attention from friendly staff who really could not do enough to help everyone a wave of the hand in the restaurant attracted at least two waiters at a time nothing seemed too much trouble brilliant start to the rest of our trip
r20
r21
this is a fantastic 5 star hotel in the heart of new delhi great spacious rooms and choice of restaurants the chinese is outstanding for breakfast you have a choice of various cuisines and freshly cooked eggs of your choice indian breakfasts from various parts of india also available above all the service by very friendly staff is just exceptional
r21
r22
it s a great property that was conveniently located for my meetings however there is little else nearby yes khan market is not far it s quiet and leafy but forget about walking to a restaurant or store you ll need to do everything on site or take a taxi somewhere breakfast is very good dinner likewise although rather over priced the rooms are nice but it feels a bit worn and dated and not to the 5 star quality of hotels elsewhere such as bangkok i know it s a south asian thing but i still expected to have a top sheet on the bed i found the staff warm and attentive and the grounds and pool were amazing returning there for business or pleasure i would shop around though
r22
r23
its located in prime areas of delhi very closer to khan market india gate hotel is very beautiful the moment you enter lobby it shouts luxury property is really well maintained loved carving on walls and celling food is really good and rooms are excellent i was disappointed with cold staff at emperor s lounge who seems lost in his own and was not helpful

r24
one would really have to scrape the dissatisfaction barrel to find something less than complementary about this large but oddly intimate establishment service is exemplary at every level with an attention to detail and personal consideration of the highest order dinner at the varq restaurant is a must extraordinary food and wonderful service with a very comprehensive wine list how many hotels do you know where a very busy breakfast area is still a haven of impeccable individualized service this is a really well managed hotel my deluxe room was rather small and the bathroom rather too small to be comfortable but very well appointed and well maintained room servicing was state of the art the spa is limited basically an extended gym but i had one of the best massages of my life chose carefully and go for a robust deep tissue treatment with one of the gentleman masseurs i came out of that massage room feeling an inch taller than when i hobbled in and i slept like a baby for 9 hours straight bliss the building is a bit of an eyesore from the outside but once inside it is all style taste and attentive calm screaming kids seemed rather more absent than present they seem to have this under control i even saw an indian waiter ask a couple of negligent parents to calm their obnoxious little raja wow laundry service perfect i m a merciless reviewer about crummy hotels so a complement from me is hard to extract if you are looking for style calm considerable comfort and world class service look no further plus i got a very attractive deal internet access was a bit patchy otherwise faultless

the taj mansingh has been a delhi landmark positioned at the edge of lutyen s delhi surrounded by elegant whitewashed bungalows for civil servants with the presidential palace and parliament looming in the distance the lobby is grand with inlaid marble granite fountains carved screens and a sprawling lobby the rooms are everything you can expect in a five star with a choice of views of the garden and the bungalows or the government complex near the presidential palace the higher up you go the better the views are breakfast was elaborate and generous with various cuisines that were represented and service was unfailing polite and good my only grouse is the ridiculousness of having to pay for wifi and for wifi being limited to one two connections it seems to be standard policy at the taj but is annoying to travellers the wifi that is available is also of poor quality
r25
r26
very good hotel very cordial staff i didn t stay at the place but i was there for an international conference the conference facilities were very good tea and snacks wee excellent food was good good decor i feel its a very very nice choice for international conferences
r26
r27
the staff were wonderful i have never come across such pleasant helpful people the rooms are fabulous really well appointed everything perfectly clean and new the breakfast buffet is extensive and caters to all tastes this has to be one of the best hotels i have ever staed in the north american hotel industry could learn a tremendous amount from this hotel s management absolutely five star
r27
r28
one of the finest indian hotels well located for those who wish to see delhi its taj at its best expert staff quiet rooms with best amneties nice food esp breakfast though they take quiet sometime to serve you a la carte but nevermind
r28
r29
this is an amazing hotel the ambience and decore was superb rich and decadent the breakfast was mind blowing the staff will offer encourage you to try traditional indian cuisine but they are not pushy about it when we stayed here their were some high ranking government officials checking in as well so that explains the caliber of this hotel security is immaculate i can t say bough about this place i felt so safe and well taken care of it was well worth the money
r29

it is difficult to unwind in a busy and congested city like new delhi especially when you are travelling with family and have an itinerary to stick to returning to our room at the taj was one of the best part of the trip according to my wife and daughter we found the staff very professional and warm every effort was made to make us feel comfortable the breakfast deserves special mention since the team served a plate of waffle with my daughters name engraved in chocolate sauce which took her by surprise however nobody is perfect after a long day of sight seeing i was dissappointed to learn that the bar didnt have any american whiskey when i requested a jack daniel i would still go back to the taj any time
