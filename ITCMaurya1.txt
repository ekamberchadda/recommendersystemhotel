whenever i am traveling in the past 6 years to delhi for business i am choosing this hotel a few of many reasons are the always hearty people that recognize you even after weeks and months the well trained staff is pro active helpful and courteous and will help you prompt the rooms are spacious well designed in a modern style and of course very clean the gym is good equipped with everything you need for a proper workout and if you prefer to have a food feast instead you go to the world class indian s number one restaurant the bukhara if you want to go for a shopping trip to the bigger malls you have to take a cab and drive for a while the itc maurya is the perfect hotel in delhi for business trips and also for short family holidays

when you enter this hotel it is obvious that this hotel is an institution in itself great amenities excellent food options and a great vibe although if you are travelling for business this hotel can be a slightly distracting with all the visitors to the restaurants in the evening the restaurants in this hotel are trademarks in new delhi however they are quite expensive for delhi
