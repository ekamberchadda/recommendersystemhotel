i stayed at the hotel lalit near the center of new delhi for three and one half nights the rooms were clean but showing their age amenities were nice and the staff very friendly minibar service was spotty and overall service was slow the food was the highlight with very good international breakfast and lunch buffets in the main cafe the rooftop restaurant the grill had great panoramas of delhi and beef steak on the menu a first for me in india i ordered the cornish game hen which was tasty but overdone while the grilled vegetables were superb i had an excellent sangiovese with dinner other disappointments were misinformation on when the gym was open and the lack of tv connection on the exercise bike the cocktail lounge was very good with excellent mixologists but the draft beer was not working room tip ask for a room on the side of the hotel not facing the railway staion to avoid the 3 47 am train whi stayed october 2014 travelled on business

we stayed at the hotel for 6 nights in early oct 14 me my wife and two 6 month babies must say that the staff went out of their way to make it a very good experience for us they accommodated all the requests which come with managing babies and two of them sometimes cranky on top of that i highly appreciate the 24 7 restaurant team mr sunil sharma the lady from the north east who was receiving diners didn t manage to get her name the chefs who rustled up fabulous food the staff who were always courteous and smiling everyone did a perfect job also the housekeeping team was excellent so also front office and concierge would definitely come back to the lalit in case i am ever in delhi again stayed october 2014 travelled with family

my family recently traveled from canad to india for my sister s wedding we stayed at the lalit for 2 weeks and loved it the rooms were clean and modern some of the showers did overflow but it s manageable the complementary bottles of water and fresh fruit that is available daily was a nice addition there is a spa onsite with a variety of services and very friendly staff we enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning in the restaurant downstairs and found the lunch dinner menu to be decent but slightly overpriced what made our stay so wonderful though was the hotel staff they could not have been more lovely and accommodating several times they went above and beyond to assist us and make us feel at home they greeted us with friendly faces and warm hellos every time we came down from our room or returned to the hotel and they all seemed genuinely interested in our stay in india what brought us there and wanted to ensure that we enjoyed our stay we left the lalit for a few days as we traveled to another area of india but returned to the lalit once back in delhi and we were greeted like old friends i have family now in india so i will be returning from time to time i will not hesitate to stay at the lalit whenever i do stayed september 2014 travelled with family

we have stayed at this hotel before it was a good experience then and it has got even better after a very quick and pleasant check in we were given a very spacious and clean non smoking room on a high floor as requested the room itself has a typical hotel chain charm i found the pillows a bit soft and the mattress a bit hard but that s me the bathroom had a large walk in overhead powerful shower which was nice the breakfast had a large variety and catered for many tastes the dishes tasted very nice although at times the service was a bit slow when there were lots of guests the freshly made dosa s and paratha s were brilliant one irritating thing i found was that there is not enough information regarding the restaurants and the bar within the hotel we had a late check out at 3 30pm all staff seem to know what they were doing and were excellent wi fi is charged extra the hotel is centrally and conveniently located close to connaught place with loads of shopping areas and there are plenty of taxi s available outside the hotel when required overall very satisfied with our stay and represented excellent value for money room tip rooms at the back are good especially if you are a fan of trains stayed september 2014 travelled as a couple

as my title is very confusing but there are certain reason for this the hotel rooms cleanliness all issues are good but the nightmare is at 28 floor in the chinese restaurant the woks dear friends i am a loyalty club member of the lalit group of hotels which is a paid membership open to all they offer certain discounts on food rooms to its members during my stay on 3 10 2014 the asst f b manager mr rohit kumar singh and few of his colleague were the star devil who spoilt the whole stay of mine in this beautiful hotel on presenting the card after meals we were very rudely and harshly refused the promised discount when i asked for the manager mr rohit kumar came and he was on the height of arrogance and rude behavior not only he said that he dont like loyalty club members also instructed us to not to visit the restaurant againetc etc friends this is a good 5 star hotel with all luxury required just avoid the woks restaurant if you are loyalty member or pray mr kumar is on holiday plz note that all other staff was is very polite and ready to help u anytime stayed october 2014

my daughter was in delhi for business and for the experience i joined her for 5 days in delhi i was met at the airport by manesh the very dapper and hospitable gentleman who had just enough conversation for someone who just stepped off of a 14 hour flight from that point on we were greeted with a smile bow and namaste for five days we enjoyed the pleasures of the lalit and those who worked there from the dining room staff concierge doormen room service which we indulged in for an entire day and our housekeeper who seemed genuinely disappointed on the day we stayed in and or mistakenly hit the dnr button our room was beautiful and roomy on the 25th floor allowing us a pretty great view of delhi and old delhi if you looked hard enough you could see the red fort amazing the bathroom was a nice size with a separate bath and stand up shower with rain shower head that we could not figure how to turn on blaaah we were near a train station but we spent all of our time traveling in taxis which were right outside the door or we utilized the car service of the hotel the pool was nice as well but could ve been a bit more clean stained chair covers for an area with very few people utilizing it the art work was fabulous and we enjoyed the daily chakra from rejuve spa which we didn t get to utilize stayed september 2014 travelled with family

this is a very good very trendy hotel in a good location near connaught place it has some great facilities and restaurants and a very trendy night club unfortunately many of the staff but thankfully not all seemed indifferent to customer service outwardly caring but unfortunately that was as far as it went some even seemed oblivious to customers needs reception desk bar staff and restaurant waiters were generally in this category however some exceptions that are worth mentioning that made me feel like a special guest were the bell captain ishu rai very helpful and knowledgeable ayesha hostess at 24 7 restaurant who was very welcoming and helpful and chef daf on the chinese food at 24 7 on the ball and bang on customer care well done this is a great hotel which i recommend and would stay at again notwithstanding some of these negatives stayed september 2014 travelled solo

the pros good location decent quality rooms the cons the worst customer service i ve had at any five start in india 1 i was left at the airport with no pick up the hotel duty manager proceeded to offer up a lot of excuses but did not apologise or offer to make it up to me 2 it took one and a half hours to have print outs sent to my room and my instructions on the email to the business centre were ignored 3 staff on the phones would put me on hold for more than 10 minutes at a time and twice hung up 3 it took 2 hours to have shampoo and an ironing board brought to my room 4 i had to wait for twenty minutes to be seen in the business centre after being told to wait for 2 minutes and complaining after 5 minutes that i hadn t been seen 5 the concierge kept taking phone calls while dealing with my recommendation for a restaurant rude and unprofessional in short i had a terrible experience at the lalit but this level of customer service seems to be standard i am unfortunate enough to have to return to the lalit in a couple of days and can only hope things will be different this time around stayed september 2014 travelled on business

it was my first trip to the hotel and the experience was great the staff were always ready to fulfil all of our requests and really did make us feel like home the service was by far the best part of the hotel for example jasmine walia came to out car to greet us and escorted us straight up to our room where she completed the check in process i thought this was a particularly great tough as after a long flight the last thing we all want to do is wait through an arduous check in process these small touches continued throughout my stay the food was also exceptional and i would like to specially mention dataram pradeep sharma and gaurav sachdeva for going the extra mile for me the concierge was also very helpful the location was also great as it was very close to the metro station overall the hotel was great and i look forward to staying again soon stayed august 2014 travelled with family

i ve stayed at this hotel umpteen times on business trips and happy to say that it has improved greatly especially in terms of recognizing regular guests and taking care of their preferences however the hotel often seems to suffer from inadequate or poorly trained staff response times are often very long for house keeping or service requests and check in and check out is usually very badly handled was kept waiting for nearly half on hour during check in well past midday check out was appalling was not informed that check out procedure was not complete because the reception did not receive instruction about one item of expenditure to be billed to company i was in a meeting right in front of the check out staff and he did not bother to inform me when i was about to leave and asked for my luggage the concierge informed me that check out wasn t complete from that point it took another half an hour and numerous phone calls to office the hotel car driver then took a disastrous detour on the way to the airport and lost his way almost missed the flight back home to calcutta after being almost a fortnight on the road on work the only reason i made it to the flight was because it was delayed i would urge the hotel management to look at staff numbers and training and the whole check in check out needs to be redesigned stayed september 2014 travelled on business

with a room on the 22nd floor i was glad the lifts worked the bedroom was ok but i m not a fan of glass walled bathrooms since i was on my own it made little practical difference wifi worked shower water was hot lights didn t work but maintenence arrived swiftly and flicked the fuse box in the ceiling void housekeeping didn t arrive to about 4pm and i was back from work by then so they made the room up around me as i worked would have been preferable if it had been done while i was out after so many indian buffet meals i selected the grill on the 23rd floor for diner it was stupidly expensive even by london standards and this is delhi and that is without being extravagant by ordering wagu or any other form of beef which would have doubled the bill the meal had a number of attempts at being noteworthy but didn t hit the high spots breads baked in a clay trough was undercooked so doghy but oils to accompany it flavoursome wine by the glass from a bottle that had oxidised and comment didn t get it replaced ambient lighting was too dark to see how the duck had been cooked but the it wasnt tough or taking on that overcooked taste duck can be prone too the orange sauce lacked depth and was mostly just sweet at 40 quid it would have been overcharged in mayfair at 60 in delhi it is daft attentive service was the high point and the evident desire to improve what is still apparently a new restaurant are plusses hotel car to airport convieniently added into bill before departure and normal super efficeient luggage handling conference centre staff attentive and well organised stayed september 2014 travelled on business
